# Mobile-First Development Path

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-05

This document outlines the agreed-upon mobile-first development path for the Mella Boutique website, based on our brainstorming session.

## Core Philosophy

The development will follow a mobile-first approach, aligning with the project's core philosophy of minimalism, discretion, and a focus on the user journey. This ensures a clean and focused experience on all devices, with a clear hierarchy of information.

## 1. The Public-Facing "Story" Page

The public-facing page will be designed as a single, elegant, scrollable narrative on mobile devices.

-   **Hero Section:** The initial view ("above the fold") will feature a powerful, full-screen hero image of the cufflink with the "Your Key, Forged." headline.
-   **Content Flow:** As the user scrolls, the "Anatomy of a Key" and "The Bearer's Mark" sections will follow in a single, vertical column. Text and images will stack to ensure readability and visual impact.
-   **No Direct "Purchase" CTA:** It is understood that this page is for storytelling only. There will be no direct navigation or call-to-action to the private commission page.

## 2. The Private "Commission" Page

This page is for approved members who arrive via a private link. The mobile experience must be direct, secure, and frictionless.

-   **Layout:** The page will use a clean, single-column layout. The "Your Journey Awaits" heading and descriptive text will be at the top, followed by a prominent "Acquire Your Key" button.
-   **Payment Form:** The form will be optimized for mobile, with large, easy-to-use input fields that stack vertically.

## Key Technical Considerations

-   **Image Optimization:** Images will be optimized for mobile to ensure fast loading times without sacrificing quality.
-   **Responsive Breakpoints:** While the design is mobile-first, we will define breakpoints to ensure the layout gracefully adapts to tablet and desktop screens.
