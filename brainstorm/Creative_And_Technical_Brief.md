**To:** Web Design & Development Team
**From:** Ken (Club Mella)
**Date:** 2025-11-04
**Subject:** Brief for the Club Mella Landing Page & Mella Boutique Site

---

## 1. Project Overview & Core Philosophy

This document outlines the requirements for two distinct but related web properties: the main **Club Mella Landing Page** and the **Mella Boutique** site.

It is critical to understand that **neither of these are conventional websites.** They are not designed for mass-market traffic, SEO, or standard user engagement metrics. Their primary purpose is to serve as highly specialized components in a meticulous, multi-stage vetting process for an ultra-exclusive private club.

The core philosophy is **discretion, mystique, and filtration.** The websites must feel exclusive, artistic, and intentionally opaque to the general public.

## 2. The Club Mella Landing Page

*   **Purpose:** To act as a digital "gate." It is a single, minimalist page designed to intrigue a very specific, pre-qualified audience and provide a single, discreet point of contact. It is a whisper, not a billboard.
*   **Audience:** Individuals who have been personally guided to the site.
*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   **Design:** Must be minimalist, elegant, and align with the high-end visual identity (see `Visual_Identity_Guidelines.md`). It should feel more like a piece of art than a webpage.
    *   **Functionality:** A static page with no navigation. The only interactive element is the "Begin the Inquiry" call-to-action, which should likely open a secure, embedded form or a `mailto:` link.
    *   **Technology:** Should be lightweight, secure, and fast-loading. No unnecessary scripts, trackers, or analytics.

## 3. The Mella Boutique Site

*   **Purpose:** To function as a secure, high-end payment portal disguised as a bespoke jeweler's website. **This is not a standard e-commerce store.** Its sole function is to process a single, high-value transaction for one product (the Mella Club Cufflink) for users who have already been approved for membership.
*   **Audience:** Vetted, approved candidates who have been sent a private, unique link to access the site.
*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   **Design:** Must feel luxurious, exclusive, and focused on the craftsmanship of the single product. The user experience should be akin to a private commission, not online shopping.
    *   **Functionality:**
        1.  A public-facing "story" page that describes the cufflink artistically.
        2.  A **private, non-indexed, link-only "Commission" page.** This is the core of the site.
        3.  This Commission page will contain a secure payment form capable of handling a high-value transaction (e.g., integrating with Stripe or a similar high-end payment processor).
        4.  **No Shopping Cart:** The concept of a "shopping cart," "quantity," or "related products" is antithetical to this site's purpose. It is a single transaction for a single item.
    *   **Security:** Security is paramount. The transaction must be encrypted and handled with the utmost integrity. The link to the commission page should ideally be single-use or time-sensitive if technically feasible.

## Summary

Think of this project as building the digital equivalent of a hidden speakeasy door and a private jeweler's vault, not a public storefront. The user experience should reflect this exclusivity at every step. Please refer to the detailed copy and visual guideline documents for further context.
